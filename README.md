# get-total-orders

_Get information about your order, the number of goods you have ordered on Tiki and Shoppe._

## **INSTRUCTION**
* Go to Shoppe or Tiki folder.
* Copy all the code in the file and paste them into the Console window (F12) in the commercial site you need to use. ([Shoppe](https://shoppe.vn) / [Tiki](https://tiki.vn))
* Sit back and enjoy.

## **NOTES**
In each file, there are variables used to customize the number of item that would be pulled, example:

```javascript
var itemPerFetch = 50;
```
You can customize it to your liking but if the number is too large, your browser may crash.
